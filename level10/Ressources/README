# The binary file use `access` which is vunerable to check permissions as its operation is not atomic

$> man 2 access

       Warning:  Using  these calls to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file
       before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security hole, because the user might ex‐
       ploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For
       this reason, the use of this system call should be avoided.
