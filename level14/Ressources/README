# There are no executables to exploit, no files for us on the filesystem, we're only left with the getflag binary to reverse

$> gdb getflag

# We set 2 breakpoints in `main` and `getuid` functions

gdb> b main
gdb> b getuid
gdb> run

# After the call to `ptrace` the register EAX is set to -1 because ptrace failed (gdb supervises the execution of the program)
# We need to trick it by changing EAX to 0

gdb> p $eax=0

# We continue the execution until `getuid` call

gdb> continue

# Then we just need to change the value of EAX (which correspond to UID)
# From /etc/passwd we see that user flag14 correspond to 3014 (0xbc6)
# So we change EAX to flag14 UID

gdb> p $eax=0xbc6
gdb> finish
